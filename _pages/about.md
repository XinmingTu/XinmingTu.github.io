I am a third year PhD student at the [Paul Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu) at University of Washington supervised by [Sara Mostafavi](http://saramostafavi.github.io). Before my PhD, I earned BSs in Biology and Computer Science from Peking University. During my undergraduate, I did some bioinformatics research at [Gao Lab](http://www.gao-lab.org/index.php/en/home/). Please see my [CV](https://xinmingtu.cn/cv/) for more information.

My research interest is using machine learning to decipher the principle of genomics. Recently my research focused on regulatory genomics under cell state context, including sequence to function, multi-omics integration, perturbation modeling.
