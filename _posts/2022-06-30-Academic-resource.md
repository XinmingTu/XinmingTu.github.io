## Introduction

Last quarter, I took the Tao of PhD seminar at University of Washington, Allen school. Even I am at california so I can't involoved so much, I learned a lot from the recommend resources covering many important topics for PhD students. In addition, I also learned a lot from the people on internet(Video, Blog, Article, Podcast) so I want to make a collection of them.<d-footnote> Some of them are written in Chinese which means original posts are in Chinese </d-footnote>

I really enjoy learning about other people's stories. It's a virtual way to gain experience from the people who have gone through the the same journey - **playing a game and reading a cheat sheet**!

Before applying for the PhD, I would like to recommend some articles to read! **PhD is not necessary for all people**.

- [Do you need a PhD?](https://medium.com/great-research/do-you-need-a-ph-d-f78d2fb0f286) by Nick Feamster
- [Advice for new graduate students](https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2010/09/27/advice-new-graduate-students/) by Jennifer Rexford

## Research Topic

Research is one of the most important things in the life of a PhD student.

- [You and your research](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.pdf) by Richard Hamming
- [Research patterns](https://greatresearch.org/2013/09/20/research-patterns/) by Nick Feamster
- [Importance of stupidity](https://journals.biologists.com/jcs/article/121/11/1771/30038/The-importance-of-stupidity-in-scientific-research) by Martin Schwartz
  > Science involves confronting our ‘absolute stupidity’. That kind of stupidity is an existential fact, inherent in our efforts to push our way into the unknown.
  > The more comfortable we become with being stupid, the deeper we will wade into the unknown and the more likely we are to make big discoveries.
- [Cultivating your research taste](https://greatresearch.org/2013/09/13/cultivating-your-research-taste/) by Nick Feamster
- [How to choose a good scientific problem](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/mcb/UriAlon/sites/mcb.UriAlon/files/uploads/nurturing/howtochoosegoodproblem.pdf) by Uri Alon.
  - We should keep _The Feasibility-Interest Diagram for Choosing a Project_ and the _The Schema of Research_ in mind
- [Finding and proposing a PhD dissertation](https://medium.com/great-research/finding-and-proposing-a-ph-d-dissertation-topic-6bca29253a0f) topic by Nick Feamster

## 中文总结

Other people's stories are quite similar to counterfactual world for us.

这一节主要是一些前人前辈的读博总结（也有工作之后的总结），**常读常新**。

- [知乎专栏 远东轶事 - 田渊栋](https://www.zhihu.com/column/yuandong) 记录了挺多田渊栋的杂谈类文章，下面是几篇看过的，最有收获的

  - [博士五年总结系列](http://yuandong-tian.com/five_year_summary_of_PhD.pdf) 里面讲述了读博五年的一些经验教训，包括怎么写作，怎么 present，怎么时间管理，以及在学习过程中心态的变化和成长，非常值得一读！
  - 博士五年之后五年的总结包括工作之后的一些心路历程和思考也值得一读！
    - [前言](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/45695338), [其一](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/45703402), [其二](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/45898250), [其三](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/46760428), [终篇](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/47840442)

- [计算机视觉 哥大读博五年总结 by Mike Shou](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/338193330) 比较详细记录了博士生涯的心路历程和成长，特别是提到了一些踩过的坑（包括和 advisor 的交流，research 相关的思考）
- [博士这五年 - 李沐](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/25099638) 相对而言有更多的 research 细节，但是同样有五年中的读博感想，很有启发。很喜欢最后一句话 _"更重要的是理想和情怀。人一生要工作五十年，为什么不花五年来追求下理想和情怀呢？"_。 另外沐神的 B 站账号[跟李沐学 AI](https://space.bilibili.com/1567748478/) 也超级棒！
- [工作五年反思 - 李沐](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/374777591) 集中分享了工作之后经验和感悟，和读博期间还挺不一样的。

## Video Channels

- [我在纽约当教授 - TT YaYa YouTube Channels](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjWnhn8mmA3DEEHlniCEoXA/videos) 非常棒的一个视频频道，为数不多的生活向学术频道，学习到了超级多（包括怎么读博，美国 funding system，教职相关的经验等等）！ TT YaYa 和摄影师太有意思啦！强力推荐！！具体的一些 video 大家可以自己挖掘~
- [Acsic People](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1PCPgKxjsK6P-po9DlBpQQ/videos) 干货浓度非常高！ [Two-body problem](https://youtu.be/gNkCcoJUJ-I), [What My Mentors Taught Me](https://youtu.be/lOOBJix9-Dw), [前车之鉴](https://youtu.be/KTcu33RghQs) 等等都非常精彩！
