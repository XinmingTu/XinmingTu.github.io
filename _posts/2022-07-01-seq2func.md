## Background

THe key question of genetics is studying the genetics process from genotype to phenotypes. genotype means the genome, the DNA sequences. Phenotype refers to an individual's observable traits, such as color, height, or weight.

However, We know there are some intermediate process from genotype to phenotypes. That's the phenotype.these including all epigenetics such as transcription factor binding, gene expression, histone modification, Chromosome organizations.

    </div>
</div>

Take previous research topic as example, Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) study the association between Genotype and Phenotype. In GWAS, the genotype usually is the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the phenotypes are traits like major human diseases.

The Expression quantitative trait loci(eQTL) study the association between Genotype and Epigenotype. In eQTL, the genotype is the variants on genome and the Epigenotype are gene expressions. Also in recently year, there is a new type of eQTL called Chromatin accessibility quantitative trait loci(caQTL). The only difference between eQTL and caQTL is the epigenotype are now chromatin accessibility rather than gene expression.

In my view, What's the regulatory genomics?
Actually, the regulatory genomics is the study of the regulatory process of the genes. It's all about the process from Genotype to epigenotype to phenotype. As for now, most of the regulatory genomics paper focus on the first part: Genotype to epigenotype.

| **Study**           | **Genotypes** | **Epigenotypes**        | **Phenotypes**  |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------- | --------------- |
| GWAS                | SNPs          | -                       | traits(disease) |
| eQTL                | Variants      | Gene expression         | -               |
| caQTL               | Variants      | Chromatin accessibility | -               |
| regulatory genomics | DNA sequences | Genomics tracks         | -               |

## The general framework

The general framework of sequence to function/activity is as follows:

THe model takes the DNA sequence as input and outputs the activity of the different genomics tracks, such as gene expression, chromatin accessibility, 3D genome structure, etc.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/seq2func/Framework.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

## Two kinds of data

So the next key question is what data should we use to train the model?
There are two kinds of data: the first one is the DNA sequence from the genome, and use sequencing methods to get the nature readout from cells. Another one is using the synthetic biology to generate the random sequences and then use experimental technology to get the measurement from a fixed system.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/seq2func/two_data.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

There are some advantages and disadvantages of the two kinds of data. We will talk about that more on our next section.

### The genome sequences

There are more than six billion base-pair of DNA in the human genom, which can be easily used as input. And we can use experimental technology to get different nature measurements from the cells, such as gene expression, chromatin accessibility, 3D genome structure, etc.

We can take the DNA sequence as input and use the model to predict the activity of the different genomics tracks.

- Predict **Gene expression** from sequences :Bassenji<d-cite key="kelley2018sequential"></d-cite>, ExPecto<d-cite key="zhou2018deep"></d-cite>, Enformer<d-cite key="avsec2021effective"></d-cite>
- Predict **chromatin accessibility** from sequence: Basset<d-cite key="kelley2016basset"></d-cite>, DanQ<d-cite key="quang2016danq"></d-cite>
  , AI-TAC<d-cite key="maslova2020deep"></d-cite>, AMBER<d-cite key="zhang2021automated"></d-cite>
- Predict the **3D structure of the genome** from sequences:Akita<d-cite key="fudenberg2020predicting"></d-cite>, DeepC<d-cite key="schwessinger2020deepc"></d-cite>, C.Origami<d-cite key="tan2022cell"></d-cite>, Orca<d-cite key="zhou2022sequence"></d-cite>
- Predict the **protein binding** from sequences: DeepBind<d-cite key="alipanahi2015predicting"></d-cite>, DeepSEA<d-cite key="zhou2015predicting"></d-cite>, BPnet<d-cite key="avsec2021base"></d-cite>

Also beyond predict one genomics tracks, we can take other genomics tracks as input too. F

- Predict the **gene expression** from sequences and **3D genome structure**: GraphReg<d-cite key="karbalayghareh2022chromatin"></d-cite>
- Predict the **Protein binding** from DNA sequences and **Chromatin accessibility**: Leopard<d-cite key="li2021fast"></d-cite>, maxATAC<d-cite key="cazares2022maxatac"></d-cite>

In this way, we can extend the method to predict cell-type specific genomics tracks. The reason is that we believe that the cell-type specific genomics tracks can be represented by the cell-type specific DNA genomics tracks so if we take that as input, so we can predict.

For example, based on our knowledge of the protein-DNA binding. There are two requirements: The DNA Sequence should contain Motifs and this region should be accessible by the protein. So It needs two kinds of information.

Figure summary:

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/seq2func/Genome_examples.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

Using genome sequences, we can use a really **long sequence** to predict the activity of the different genomics tracks. Even across the whole chromosome<d-cite key="zhou2022sequence"></d-cite>. Therefore, we can study the complex mechanism of the genome including almost all possible regulation process.(Promoter, enhancer, repressor, long-range loop, compartments change). Also we can take the data from different cell types as input, so it's possible to predict the cell-type specific genomics tracks.

Meanwhile, there are also some disadvantages of using genome sequences.

- The most important one is that the sample size is limited. For example, if we want to predict gene expression, the sample size won't be larger than the number of genes$$3000 – 40000$$. If we want to predict chromatin accessibility, the sample size will be larger than the number of open chromatin regions. If we don't consider the overlapping between different inputs, the sample size $$N$$ should be samller than $$\frac{L_{genome}}{L_{input}}$$. It's the nature limitation of sample size.
- Another limitation is that the input genome is from the genome which means it's the steady state in the evolution. We cannot's get any flexibility in the input genome though the population level there will be some variants.
- Pros:
  - Long sequences(L)
  - Complex mechanism
  - Enhancer, Promoter, 3D structure
  - Different Cell types
- Cons: - Small sample size $$ n $$
  - Genes ~ , $$ N \times L < total length $$
  - Steady state
  - Limited space, It’s the evolution steady status. Correlated to each other

### The random sequences

If we synthesize the random sequences and introduce these sequences into different position in the genome, we can study the function of this element in a very flexible way. There are also some papers working on this topic.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/seq2func/randome_sequence.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

We can use random sequences as **Promoter** to study the mechanism of promoter<d-cite key="de2020deciphering, vaishnav2022evolution"></d-cite>. We can also use random sequences as 3'UTR<d-cite key="griesemer2021genome"></d-cite> or 5'UTR<d-cite key="sample2019human, cuperus2017deep"></d-cite> to study the mechanism of the 5'UTR or 3'UTR. Futhermore, we can use random sequences as **enhancer** and **Promoter**<d-cite key="sahu2022sequence"></d-cite>

There are some advantages and disadvantages of the random sequences. As for the advantages, we can generate a large number of random sequences to get a large sample size. (More than 300 millions). Also there is no constraint on the sequences, the sequence space is flexible. we can synthesize any sequences we want and do experiments to valid the model predictions.

However, We only can study **the simple system**(such as yeast) in this way, and the sequence will be **short**(usually the length is not longer than 200). As a result, the mechanism will also be very **local and simple**.

- Pros:
  - Large sample size
  - Flexible sequences
  - Experimental validation
- Cons:
  - Simple system
  - Short sequences
  - Local mechanism

## From model to new biology

Now, we have the data and the model. What's next? The final goal is to find the new biology knowledge or principle. So we need to dig into the model and find the new biology.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/seq2func/new_biology.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

### Decipher the regulatory process from the model

The first kind of application is to decipher the regulatory process from the model.

After the training, the model already has the knowledge of the regulatory process. So we can use the explainable AI method(Such as DeepLift<d-cite key="shrikumar2017learning"></d-cite>, SHAPLY<d-cite key="lundberg2017unified"></d-cite>) to decipher the regulatory process.

We can learn the regulatory elements from the model(TF-Modisco<d-cite key="shrikumar2018technical"></d-cite>) and also get the relationship between the regulatory elements.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/seq2func/decipher_model.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

### Simulator to optimize and do experiments in virtual

The second kind of application is using the model to simulate the regulatory process in virtual and we can also use the simulator to optimize the sequence and do engineering experiments.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/seq2func/model_simulator.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

We have a trusty simulator(Simulator) and we can use the simulator to do experiments in virtual and introduce insilico mutations to study the effect of variants which can even extend to a large structure variants(such as deletion, insertion, and duplication). Also we can use the simulator to do some evolutionary studies. We can mimic the evolution of the regulatory process.

## Summary

So in this post, we have learned the following:
There are two kinds of data: The genome sequences, The random sequences and two kinds of applications: Decipher the regulatory process from the model, Simulator to optimize and do experiments in virtual
